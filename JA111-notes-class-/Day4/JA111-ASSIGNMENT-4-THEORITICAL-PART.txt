

Q1) Differentiate between static and non-static variables?

Ans:-  The members where static ketword is applied is known as static member
and the members on which static members is not applied is called non static
members.

     All the static members directly stored in RAM before execution and all 
the non static members initially stored in the hard disk as a bytecode.

    To get non static members in RAM we have to create object.When JVM  will
encountered with new operator it will reserve some memory in heap area of RAM.
